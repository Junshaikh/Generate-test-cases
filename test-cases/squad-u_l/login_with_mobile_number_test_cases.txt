    And the user should see a success message "Login successful!"
    And the user should be logged in

  Scenario: Login with Invalid Mobile Number Format
    Given the user enters an invalid mobile number "12345"
    And the user enters a valid password "Password123"
    When the user clicks the "Login" button

    And the user should remain on the Login page
    And the user should not be logged in

  Scenario: Login with Non-Existent Mobile Number
    Given the user enters a non-existent mobile number "9999999999"
    And the user enters a valid password "Password123"
    When the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Mobile number not registered"
    And the user should remain on the Login page
    And the user should not be logged in

  Scenario: Login with Incorrect Password
    Given the user enters a valid mobile number "1234567890"
    And the user enters an incorrect password "WrongPassword"
    When the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Incorrect password"
    And the user should remain on the Login page
    And the user should not be logged in

  Scenario: Login with Empty Mobile Number
    Given the user does not enter a mobile number
    And the user enters a valid password "Password123"
    When the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Please enter your mobile number"
    And the user should remain on the Login page
    And the user should not be logged in

  Scenario: Login with Empty Password
    Given the user enters a valid mobile number "1234567890"
    And the user does not enter a password
    When the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Please enter your password"
    And the user should remain on the Login page
    And the user should not be logged in

  Scenario: Login with Mobile Number Containing Characters other than Digits
    Given the user enters an invalid mobile number "123-456-7890"
    And the user enters a valid password "Password123"
    When the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Invalid mobile number format"
    And the user should remain on the Login page
    And the user should not be logged in

  Scenario: Remember Me Functionality
    Given the user enters a valid mobile number "1234567890"
    And the user enters a valid password "Password123"
    And the user checks the "Remember Me" checkbox
    When the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to the "Home" page
    And the user should be logged in
    And the mobile number should be pre-filled on the Login page on next visit

  Scenario: Login with leading/trailing spaces in Mobile Number
    Given the user enters a mobile number with leading and trailing spaces "  1234567890  "
    And the user enters a valid password "Password123"
    When the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to the "Home" page
    And the user should see a success message "Login successful!"
    And the user should be logged in

**Explanation:**

*   **Feature:** Describes the overall feature being tested - "Login with Mobile Number".
*   **Background:** Sets up the initial state for all scenarios.  Here, it ensures the user starts on the Login page.
*   **Scenario:** Represents a specific test case.
*   **Given:** Specifies the initial context or preconditions.
*   **When:** Describes the action the user takes.
*   **Then:** States the expected outcome or result.
*   **And:** Used to chain together multiple Given, When, or Then steps for better readability.

**Key Considerations and Improvements:**

*   **Data-Driven Testing:**  For scenarios that are similar but use different input data (like invalid mobile numbers), consider using Scenario Outlines (Tables) to avoid repeating the same steps multiple times.
*   **Error Message Verification:**  The test cases verify the *presence* of error messages. You could extend them to verify the *exact content* of the error message if that's important.
*   **Password Complexity:** Consider adding scenarios to test password complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
*   **Security Testing:**  The example lacks security-related tests. Consider adding scenarios to test for:
    *   **Brute-force protection:** What happens after multiple failed login attempts?
    *   **SQL injection:** Can malicious SQL code be entered into the mobile number or password fields?
    *   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Can malicious JavaScript code be injected into the login fields?
*   **Localization:** If the application supports multiple languages, add scenarios to test the login functionality in different languages.  This would involve verifying the error messages are displayed correctly.
*   **Accessibility:** While these tests are focused on functionality, remember to consider accessibility when designing the UI for the login page (e.g., screen reader compatibility).  You could have separate accessibility tests.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** If 2FA is enabled after the initial password, you'll need additional scenarios to test that flow.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Important for security. Add a scenario to verify that there is a rate limit applied to failed login attempts. This prevents brute-force attacks.
*   **Mobile Number Validation Rules:** Be explicit about what constitutes a valid mobile number (e.g., country code, length, allowed characters).  This will help define comprehensive test cases.

**Example of Scenario Outline for Invalid Mobile Numbers:**

```gherkin
  Scenario Outline: Login with Various Invalid Mobile Number Formats
    Given the user enters an invalid mobile number "<mobile_number>"
    And the user enters a valid password "Password123"
    When the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Invalid mobile number format"
    And the user should remain on the Login page
    And the user should not be logged in

    Examples:
      | mobile_number  |
      | 12345        |
      | ABCDEFGH     |
      | 123-456-789  |
      | 1234567890123|  # Too long
      |              |  # Empty String (This is similar to the existing scenario but included for completeness)
```

By incorporating these additions and improvements, you can create a more robust and comprehensive set of test cases for your "Login with Mobile Number" feature. Remember to tailor the tests to the specific requirements and context of your application.
